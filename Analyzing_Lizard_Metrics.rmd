<B>Data set Description:</B>  

This data set is an XLSX (Microsoft Excel file) which contains three variables one about one categorical variable: Sex of the lizard, and another two about the numerical length of the lizard and heart rate of the lizard. The length of the Lizard is described as centimeters. This data set was designed in June 2022. This data set consists of a total of 120 observations.  
Body metrics are an important aspect when we talk about the blood supply of any living creature, therefore in this data set, we will analyze the length and the heart rate since the heart rate and cardiac output of a lizard are directly proportional to the length of the lizard, Meiri, S. (2010).



<B>Hypothesis Testing in Medical Industry: </B>  

Hypothesis is something which is based on the educated guess or in simple words assumptions about the population. The first ever hypothesis testing was done and invented by Karl Pearson in 1857; a scientist from London, He invented this test to be used in variety of different fields such as in the field of Biology, Economics and Psychology, Magnello, M. E. (2005). In the above mentioned study by Pearson, K. published in 1922 states that when we take substantial amount of observations, we do not have any technique through which we can find the mean of population 1 and population 2 therefore to make this possible he invented hypothesis testing which is generally getting predictions for the outcome according to statistical data. According to a famous book written by Bluman, A.G published in 2009 defined Hypothesis in two terms:

1. Null Hypothesis: Bluman defines Null Hypothesis as a statistical hypothesis that shows zero difference between the two distinct population groups, the null hypothesis is denoted by H0.

2. Alternative Hypothesis: Bluman defines an alternative hypothesis as another term that states that there is a significant level of difference between the two population groups, basically it is an element that helps in rejecting the null hypothesis.

Let’s take an example for Hypothesis,   

A statistician wants to know the mean heart rate of the lizards therefore the Hypothesis here will be:  
H0: U = 1.68  
H1: U = =/= 1.68

Therefore, the hypothesis states that:
Null Hypothesis: mean of the lizard’s heart rate is 1.68 and will not change, whereas Alternative Hypothesis: tell the lizard’s heart rate is not equal to 1.68 or is more or less than 1.68.

In the medical industry, hypothesis testing is one of the important aspects in all fields, the most important of hypothesis testing is to plan, implement and get the desired outcome. The medical industry always experiments on two groups, one is the control group and another one is the focus group, these two groups define the result of every clinical trial, therefore to test the difference between a control and a focus group hypothesis testing is used. 
Let’s take an example: The statement of the problem here is to see whether vaccination against Covid - 19 is effective in decreasing the severity of Covid - 19 symptoms. So, our hypothesis here is Vaccination against Covid -19 helps in reducing the severity of Covid - 19 but on the other hand, the null hypothesis does not see any difference, it states that vaccination and Covid - 19 are independent of each other.
AS we saw the examples now, we know that the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis both are opposite to each other and the only reason we do hypothesis testing is to reject the null hypothesis.


<B>Z-test, T-Test and F-Test in comparing two population parameters: </B>  

According to Bluman, A.G published book in 2009 which describes different test required to find statistical differences between the two population parameters,   

1. Z-Test: According to Bluman In hypothesis testing we need to calculate the z value, which can be only be used whenever the mean of the two population parameters is equal between the two population.

The above figure 1 shows the formula for the Z-Test to calculate difference between two population parameter.  
</Center>
<BR>
  
2. T-Test: According to Bluman, T-test is used most commonly when the variables used in the test are independent of each other, and another will be when we don't know the mean of the whole population and if they are equal between each other, using two variables, one variable describes the group and other measures the interest.

The above figure 2 shows the formula for the T-Test to calculate difference between two population parameter.
</Center>  
  
<BR>

3. F-Test: According to study by R.A. Fisher published in 1928  defined F test as the ratio between the two variances which is V1 and other is V2 which is also described in a similar study by Duncan, D. B. published in 1955, states that if null hypothesis which is denoted by H0 defines mean and variance to be zero therefore the F statistics would be equal to one, Duncan also stated that F-test is based on two theoretical explanation: all the samples should have normal distribution and samples should be completely independent of each other. If these conditions are met than null hypothesis cannot be rejected and therefore the data has a distribution called as F distribution.

<B>Importance of referencing in paper </B>  
Academic referencing and citing every content is an important aspect of student integrity, as a data scientist it is important to be well oriented with citing resources since the use of articles and other academic resources is of great importance and is needed t make papers more credible and worthy since improper citations can reduce the overall quality of the paper published, Santini, A. (2018).   
Improper citing in the medical industry can also end up in difficult consequences, which can also result in legal action against the author who was charged with that guilt, in the biomedical industry it is important to maintain an integrity level, so that papers that are published are of high quality and without errors, since once the grant is denied due to negligence in the citation, that particular company cannot apply for a grant again, it will cost the company its resources, money and time, Masic, I. (2013).

<BR><B> In the above task to display results I have generated three visualization, two tables and one density plot. In the density plot it is easy to visualize the difference between the P value which is ``r PValue``, Critical Value to the right which is ``r CriticalValueR``, and Alpha value which is ``r Alpha2``, now interpreting this values: as seen in the density plot P-Value is denoted in red which is greater than alpha which is denoted by purple line, shows that we cannot reject null hypothesis and Z-Test value which is lesser than Critical Value again denotes that we failed to reject null hypothesis therefore  
1. According to Critical Value Approach Male and female lizards have the same length  
2. According to P-value approach Male and Female lizards have the same length  
Therefore we do not have enough evidence to reject null hypothesis.</B>

<BR><B> Since we need to confirm the hypothesis we tested in the above task we need to run the numbers using the F test, F-test is not the one on which we should rely on to get the hypothesis results but P-Value approach is also necessary.Therefore according to F-test value which is  ``r FTest`` comparing it to the ``r FCriticalValue3`` we do not have enough evidence to reject null hypothesis. Now coming back to the question is female length variance higher than the male variance?  
So according to the data presented above we cannot reject the null hypothesis which states that there is no difference between the variance of the female and male length, therefore answer is that female length variance is same as the variance of male length.

<BR><B> The results of this observation are same as the above task for length of the lizards but for this task we will be using heart rate of lizards, The critical value was calculated using two methods one was the traditional method to find the value and other was the R stats method.  
In this task we can observe that Z-Test value which is ``r ZTestValue4`` is less than the critical value ``r CriticalValueR`` therefore null hypothesis cannot be rejected.  
We also observed the P-value which is ``r PValue4`` is also more than the alpha which is ``r Alpha4`` hence null hypothesis is not rejected.
  
Hence we can conclude that from above data we do not have enough evidence to reject null hypothesis on 99% confidence level and 0.01 significance level therefore there is no significant difference between the heart rate of male and female lizards.</B>

<BR><B> We have use the same strategy as we have used in the task 3, we have derived different values which will help us in deriving hypothesis, We have taken two approaches into consideration to check whether how confident are we with confidence level of <Mark> 99%  </Mark> and significance level of <Mark> 1% </Mark> that will leave us an alpha value of ``r Alpha3``, So according to our value we will be deriving our hypothesis at 99% confidence level:  
1. According to the Critical value approach we have rejected our null hypothesis the reason is that F-Test which is derived by two population variance is ``r FTest`` is less than the Critical value ``r FCriticalValue5_2 `` therefore accordingly we need to reject null hypothesis, Bluman, A. G. (2009).  
2. According to P-Value Approach at 99% Confidence level with 1% significance level we get a P-Value of ``r PValue3`` this is greater than the ``r Alpha3`` then we accept null hypothesis. Bluman, A. G. (2009).

According to data above we do not have enough evidence to reject null hypothesis and therefore there is no difference between variance of heart rate of two populations.

<BR>To find whether there is difference between the two population by means of meditation and sleep quality, therefore we have tested for the two populations differences which are dependent or paired with each other. Therefore we calculated for the test value of the differences which is ``r TestValue6`` which is less than the critical value which is ``r CV6`` and therefore here we do not have enough evidence to reject null hypothesis thus we have accepted it and rejected alternative hypothesis.  
Hence,According to the data meditation has no effect on the sleep quality, therefore we fail to reject null hypothesis at 99% Confidence level and 1% significance level.  <B>

<B> <U> CONCLUSION </U> </B> 
</FONT>
</CENTER>

This data set consist of 120 observation from which 60 sets of males and 60 sets of females, this 120 sets consist of heart rate and length. From the data set we have analyze the data for hypothesis testing. 
This project included using different analytical skills such as visualization and Hypothesis testing.Most of the data shows no difference in the two population, in regards to heart rate and length. Different hypothesis testing approaches are used in this project Critical value and P-Value approach. As we can see in this project critical value is an important aspect when we are testing for hypothesis, whereas the P-Value approach is more common and is a quality test since it provides us with precision points in the set of observations of null hypothesis for hypothesis testing.In this project we have used three types of test which is Z-Test, F-Test and T-test. T-Test used in this project was different than the other T-Test since it was used to calculate for differences between the two population. Most of the test had the same results while rejecting null hypothesis, therefore showing no significant difference between the newly collected data. When two data are paired or dependent on each other we use a very special T -Test which will calculate the means of the dependent variables and further derive values which will result in decision of the hypothesis whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis.   

Considering the hypothesis testing with the above data for two differences we also need to keep in mind about the errors which can occur, such as type 1 error which means we reject a null hypothesis which is actually true about the population, whereas type 2 error results when we accept the null hypothesis which is supposed to be false in the whole population. Therefore errors should be considered seriously since in medical field it can be dangerous to develop drugs with wrong predictions. Therefore it is recommended to use a P-value approach every time for hypothesis testing to avoid any errors which can make the data invalid.  

This project sharpened by skills to do hypothesis testing, it also helped me in learning new F-Test approach to define the hypothesis testing, practicing calculating different test such as Z-test, F-Test and T-test will help me in advancing in my career and will help me to increase my knowledge in analytics which will help me to make better decisions in the near future relating to the actual industrial experience.
